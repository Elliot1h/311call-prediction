# 311call-prediction
What we did in this project

Predict the daily 311 inbound calls for the next 7 days

•	Given two types of data: 311 Service requests, and weather. The 311 Service requests dataset contains all the 311 calls from 2016 to 2018 with many different features including timestamps, location, service request descriptions, etc. 

•	Aggregate the 311 records in ways that best describes the characteristics of the inbound call patterns. Explain and visualize our findings.

•	The weather data contains the weather information from the weather stations in NYC from 2010 to 2018 in daily intervals. Describe and visualize our findings.

•	The final goal of this project is to predict the daily 311 inbound calls for the next 7 days 

•	Use the insights from previous sections to build a predictive model of choice – explain the assumptions of our model and why we picked it.

•	Perform features selections in our model and explain how does data exploration process help to decide which features incorporated in the model

•	Evaluate the impact of weather on the call volume, find patterns and define causal impact if there’s any. 

•	Build a reasonable model framework, explain our model results, and justify the relationships identified in the model.
